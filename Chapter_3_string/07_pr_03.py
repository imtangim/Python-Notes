story="Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a young boy named Tangim. Tangim was known for his adventurous spirit and was always eager to explore the unknown. One day, while on a walk in the nearby woods, Tangim stumbled upon a hidden cave. Being the curious person that he was, Tangim decided to venture inside.\nAs he explored the cave, he discovered a magical lantern that glowed with a warm light. Tangim picked up the lantern and suddenly heard a faint whisper. It was the voice of the lantern, who told Tangim that he was granted three wishes.\nExcited by the opportunity, Tangim wished for wealth, power, and fame. In an instant, all of his wishes were granted.  Tangim became rich, famous, and powerful beyond his wildest dreams.\nHowever, as time passed, Tangim realized that wealth, power, and fame had brought him nothing but loneliness and emptiness. He longed for the simple life he once had and the people who loved him for who he was, not what he had.\nTangim made a fourth wish to the lantern, asking for all his previous wishes to be undone. The lantern granted his request and Tangim was returned to his humble life, surrounded by the love of his friends and family.\nFrom that day on, Tangim lived a happy and fulfilling life, always remembering the lessons he learned about the true meaning of happiness and the importance of being true to oneself."
